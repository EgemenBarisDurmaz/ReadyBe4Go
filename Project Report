Opening a restaurant is always a trend in the constantly growing service industry. There are some reasons behind this trend, such as the attractiveness of managing your own business and growth opportunities. However, it is not as easy as it might seem to launch and run a restaurant, since restaurant owners are in a risky situation in a highly competitive market. 
In the current environment, when someone wants to launch a new restaurant, they canâ€™t find an easily accessible support system to help them decide the features of the planned restaurant. That is why they make their plans for their upcoming business by using traditional methods such as consulting a professional. However, these features are crucial factors that will determine their success. In the results of our research, we found out that the rating of a restaurant in a mobile restaurant finder application is a strong indicator of success in terms of both the number of customers and the image of the restaurant in the minds of the people.
